### Motivation
<p>Peer-to-peer borrowing or rental markets, otherwise known as the sharing economy, have surfaced as alternative suppliers of services traditionally delivered by long-established companies in industries that were previously thought to have a high barrier to entry. Since its founding in 2008, Airbnb has been successful in disturbing the well-established hotel industry â€“ becoming the poster child of a thriving business modeled after the sharing economy. By finding a way to enable users to make passive income on property that would otherwise be vacant, Airbnb has found a creative approach to balancing the supply and demand for affordable short-term housing. One of the unique features that helps Airbnb balance this supply and demand is their suggested price feature. This feature offers hosts a suggested listing price based on the information provided in the listing in addition to existing reviews and host ratings. The price suggestion features helps hosts have a better idea of the fair market value of their listing, therefore better optimizing user experience by further streamlining the process of listing, thus enhancing overall user experience.</p>

### Objectives
<p>In this project, by using the Seattle Airbnb Data at 2016, I explore the feature that might affect price. I also use the given information provided in an Airbnb listing to implement price suggestion model. My two key objectives are:</p>

* Cleaning and streamlining our data set to focus on key variables that have predictive potency in predicting listing price.
* Analyzing the relationship that date has on listing price, to better help optimize our model to predict the optimal listing price on a specified date.
